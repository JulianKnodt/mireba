# Ray Weekend

A raytracer initially built off the raytracer in a weekend file. I've added additional features
including different objects, indexed triangle lists, and hopefully more as time goes on.

# TODO

Implement some random generator for objects
Fix noise by implementing a better sampling strategy
More materials
Add fluids
